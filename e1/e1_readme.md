### e1)

#### q1)

Using the “randn” function, write a script that produces an array of size N (which is a input variable) with random symbols -1 and 1 that appear with the same probability.


#### q2)

Do the same thing with the Question 1, but now use the function “rand”.


#### q3)

Using the “rand” function, write a function that produces an array of size N (which is a input variable) of randomly distributed symbols -1 and 1 with a P(-1)=0.75.


#### q4)

Write a function that takes uses as an input the outcomes of Question 1, 2, or 3 and calculates the relative frequency of appearance of each symbol (i.e., -1 and 1). Then, run this function for N=10, 100 and 1000. What do you observe?
