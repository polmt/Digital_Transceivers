### e1-q1
Write a Matlab script that simulates a system where two different users (i.e., User 1 and User 2), transmit to a single-antenna Base-Station, with the corresponding transmission channels being model as zero-mean complex Gaussian channels of variance of one. Assume that only one User transmits at each time instant, a BPSK modulated symbol (i.e., x!, x" ϵ{−1, +1}). Which User transmits, is selected randomly, independently and with equal probability. Assume that the noise at the Base-Station has a variance of 0.1.
