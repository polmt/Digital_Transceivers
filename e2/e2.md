#### q1)

- Produce an array of N:10, 100 and 1000 random samples by using both rand, and randn and then write a script calculating the mean and the variance for each array. </span>
- Compare the MATLAB outcome with the theoretical results.
- For each of the above cases plot the difference between the practical and the theoretical value.


#### q2)

Use randn to produce an array of 1000 samples of a complex Gaussian process with independent real and imaginary parts, and (a) variance of 2 and (b) variance 4.
