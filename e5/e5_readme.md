#### q1)

Simulate and plot the Symbol-Error-Rate (SER) as a function of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) for a Single-Input, Single-Output system transmitting 4-QAM symbols, over a flat-fading Rayleigh channel.


#### q2)

Simulate and plot the Symbol-Error-Rate (SER) as a function of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) for a 1x2 MIMO system, when transmitting 4-QAM symbols, over a 1x2 MIMO flat-fading Rayleigh, and when we optimal receiver combination is performed.
